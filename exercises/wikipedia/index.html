			<p>Little Island at Pier 55 (stylized as Little Island @Pier55) is an artificial island park in the Hudson River west of Manhattan in New York City, adjoining Hudson River Park. Designed by Heatherwick Studio, it is near the intersection of West Street and 13th Street in the Meatpacking District and Chelsea neighborhoods of Manhattan. It is located slightly west of the Manhattan shoreline atop Hudson River Pier 55, connected to Hudson River Park in Manhattan by footbridges at 13th and 14th Streets.</p>
			<p>Little Island covers 2.4 acres (0.97 ha) and is supported by 132 pot-shaped structures (called "tulips") suspended above the water, which in turn stand on 280 concrete pilings extending into the riverbed. The tops of the pots range from 15 to 62 ft (4.6 to 18.9 m) above the mean waterline. The installation of the pots was overseen by engineer Arup Group and manufactured in Upstate New York by the Fort Miller Company. The park has various lawns, paths, and plants, which were arranged by landscape architect Signe Nielsen. The plantings and soil were engineered to reduce erosion and were also arranged aesthetically. In addition, Little Island has a small stage and three concession stands, as well as a 687-seat amphitheater.</p>
			<p>Plans arose in November 2014 for a new park, known as Pier 55, designed by Heatherwick Studio and largely funded by Barry Diller and Diane von Fürstenberg, with some funding from the New York City and state governments. Originally, construction was to begin in 2015 and the park would have been completed in 2018 or 2019. However, the park's construction was delayed by lawsuits from the City Club of New York. Plans for the pier were scrapped in September 2017 due to lawsuits and cost overruns. The next month, the proposal was revived when New York Governor Andrew Cuomo agreed to provide funding for the park. Construction of the structure began in April 2018 and a symbolic cornerstone was laid in December 2018. The project was renamed Little Island in 2019 and opened on May 21, 2021.</p>

			<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Little Island adjoins Hudson River Park near the intersection of West Street and 13th Street in Manhattan.[1][2] The park is in the Meatpacking District and Chelsea neighborhoods of Manhattan.[3] Commissioned by businessman Barry Diller and designed by Thomas Heatherwick's company Heatherwick Studio, the park covers 2.4 acres (0.97 ha).[4][2] It is accessible from two passageways extending across the water from Hudson River Park: a southern esplanade at Little West 12th Street and a northern esplanade at 14th Street.[1][5] The park can fit 1,000 people simultaneously.[6] As of 2021, the park is open from 6 a.m. to 1 a.m. daily, but visitors are required to book reservations if they visit after noon.[1][2][7]</p>
				<h3>Structural design</h3>
					<p>Arup Group oversaw the structural design of the park.[8][9] Little Island is supported by 132 pot-shaped structures suspended above the water.[8][10] These "tulip pots" vary in height and are between 15 and 62 ft (4.6 and 18.9 m) above the mean waterline.[8] This was meant to protect the park from a 500-year flood, in which the water level in the river rises as much as 11 ft (3.4 m).[11] The heights of the pots was intended to give the appearance of a floating leaf[2] or a wave.[11] Numerous other firms were involved in the structural design, including precast cement contractor Fort Miller Company, marine consultant Mueser Rutledge Consulting Engineers, and marine contractor Weeks Marine.[11]</p>
					<p>Each pot has four to six lightweight concrete sections, referred to as "petals", which are designed to reduce the load on the pilings.[10][11] The precast concrete is also meant to be resistant to erosion and corrosion.[11] The concrete pots were manufactured by the Fort Miller Company at their factory in Easton in Upstate New York.[10][12] The Fort Miller Company hired a partner to create foam molds for the pieces of the pots using a laser cutter, then cleared out a 600-foot-long building for these foam pieces. Thirty-nine types of molds were fabricated. According to the company's president, "A full one-third of our annual production capacity was displaced by this project."[11]</p>
					<p>After the petals were manufactured, they were driven to the Port of Coeymans, a port on the Hudson River south of Albany, New York. At the Port of Coeymans, Weeks Marine assembled the individual petals and used a crane to load them onto barges. The barges typically traveled from the Port of Coeymans to Manhattan in 14 hours.[11] Once in Manhattan, the pots were installed on their supports using a 350-ton crane. The largest support is 30 ft (9.1 m) tall and weighs 90 short tons (80 long tons; 82 t).[10][12] The pots stand on 267[11] or 280 concrete pilings, which extend at most 200 ft (61 m) into the bottom of the Hudson River.[8][9] Each piling measures 3 ft (0.91 m) in diameter and can handle loads of 250 to 350 short tons (220 to 310 long tons; 230 to 320 t). The pilings were hollowed at their cores, with metal guide rails to allow the pots to be installed without the pilings tipping over. The edges of the pots are placed 9 ± 3 in (229 ± 76 mm) apart.[11]</p>
				<h3>Landscape</h3>
					<p>Signe Nielsen of Mathews Nielsen Landscape Architects was the landscape architect for the park,[4][8] while BrightView Landscape Development was the landscape contractor.[11] Nielsen "wanted New Yorkers to feel delight and excitement around every turn from the moment they set foot here."[8][9] To accomplish this, the plantings were arranged in specific color patterns. For instance, a portion of the park was planted with yellow, gold, lavender, and purple plants contrasting with each other.[13]</p>
					<p>The landscape includes 35 tree species and 65 shrub species.[14][15][16] In addition, there are 270 species of perennials and grasses.[14][15][a] At the park's opening in 2021, the landscape contained sixty-six thousand bulbs and 114 trees.[3][8] The original trees are up to 35 ft (11 m) tall with trunk diameters of 12 in (300 mm).[11] The trees are planted in 4 ft (1.2 m) of soil, which is stabilized by geofibers and fed by a large irrigation system.[11] The composition of the soil was engineered to reduce erosion, and evergreens and other plantings were used to shield the park from strong winds from the Hudson River.[13]</p>
					<p>The park's four corners are designed with different topologies.[15] There are three lawns, as well as a "secret garden" planted exclusively with white flora.[14] One of the lawns, the Main Lawn, is in the center of the park.[1] Alongside the landscapes, the park contains scenic observation areas as well as plazas and performance spaces.[4][17] There are overlooks at the northwest, southwest, and southeast corners of the park.[1][15] Walkways lead up to the highest portions of Little Island, in a layout similar to the southern portion of Governors Island.[14]</p>
